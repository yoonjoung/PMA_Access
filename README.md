# Effective Access, using PMA surveys 

There are three groups of files in this repo.  

1. Program files  
--- 1.1 Effective_Access_Indicators_IR.do: Stata do file to create estimates of potential indicators from female surveys (summary_Access_Indicators_IR.dta)  
--- 1.2 Effective_Access_Indicators_CR.do: Stata do file to create estimates of potential indicators from client exit surveys (summary_Access_Indicators_CR.dta)   
--- 1.3 Effective_Access_Pop_SDP_Link.do: Stata do file to link EAs with SDPs, and create summary of link quality (EA_SDP_Link_Summary.dta) --- 1.4 Effective_Access_Pop_SDP_Link.do: Stata do file to (1) link SDP with EA, (2) create EA-level service environment variables, (3) create link quality results dataset (EA_SDP_Link_Summary.dta), and (4) assess link results       
--- 1.5 Effective_Access_Pop_SDP_Link.Rmd: R markdown file to produce link results assessment     

2. Data files are survey-level summary datasets. There are three, and each is saved in both Stata dta and csv files (thus 6 data files in total).    
--- 2.1 summary_Access_Indicators_IR.dta: estimates of potential indicators from female surveys   
--- 2.2 summary_Access_Indicators_CR.dta: estimates of potential indicators from client exit surveys   
--- 2.3 EA_SDP_Link_Summary.dta: results of EA-SDP linkage   

3. Folders to create Shiny apps 

4. Other documention in PDF or word files.
